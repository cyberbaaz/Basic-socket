# Basic-socket
Using socket library establishing a TCP connection/stream which can be then used for various purpose like remote command execution,any message or file transfer or even a backdoor.

*Will work only on python2 and no serialisation implemented,so will throw many errors*

# For now you can use netcat to listen on the port
    netcat -vv -l -p 4444

> This a basic socket demonstration.
> Will update the code or publish any backdoor package 
> Listener will also be included in that
> Anyone can fork this or create pull request for open-source contests
